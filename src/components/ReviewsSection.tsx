He was fast and planned for things we didn't even think of like insulation for the outside wall pipes. He's got a sweet dog too, that he brings along sometimes. He's not one for small talk but gets right to work and gets the job done. Highly recommend!"

Garrett showed up and offered a quick fix as well as a longer-term option that would address other plumbing issues we had been having elsewhere in the house. I very much appreciated his hard work, transparency, and options. Highly recommended!!!"
